Code for the simualtion of low driving mileage bias: 

Summary:
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) has become an increasingly valuable tool to assess unmeasured confounding. 
This study applies MCSs to quantify suspected unmeasured confounding, i.e. low driving mileage, 
on the effect of polypharmacy and road traffic crashes (RTCs) in older  adults.

Aim: To determine the impact of low driving mileage bias on the effect of polypharmacy
on RTCs in older adults.

This study applies a MCS approach to the case of unmeasured confounding, namely low annual
driving mileage, on the effect of polypharmacy on road traffic crashes (RTCs) in older
adults. The term unmeasured confounding is used to refer to confounding due to lack of data for
adjustment and consequent omission from the statistical model. In addition, we define concurrent
consumption of five or more prescribed medications in a 90-days period as polypharmacy.

The code for the simulation for can be used and edited based on different assumptions and parameters.
