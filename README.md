**Simulation of unmeasured confounding**

Summary
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) has become an increasingly valuable tool to assess unmeasured confounding. 
This study applies MCSs to quantify suspected unmeasured confounding, i.e. low driving mileage, 
on the effect of polypharmacy and road traffic crashes (RTCs) in older  adults.

Aim
To determine the impact of low driving mileage bias on the effect of polypharmacy
on RTCs in older adults.
