# Simulation of unmeasured confounding

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) has become an increasingly valuable tool to assess unmeasured confounding. 
This study applies MCSs to quantify suspected unmeasured confounding, i.e. low driving mileage, on the effect of polypharmacy and road traffic crashes (RTCs) in older adults.
