Code for the simualtion of low driving mileage bias: 

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) has become an increasingly valuable tool to assess unmeasured confounding. 
This study applies MCSs to quantify suspected unmeasured confounding, i.e. low driving mileage, 
on the effect of polypharmacy and road traffic crashes (RTCs) in older  adults.

Aim: To determine the impact of low driving mileage bias on the effect of polypharmacy
on RTCs in older adults.

The code for the simulation for can be used and edited based on different assumptions and parameters.
